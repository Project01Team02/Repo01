<p>This is a site that uses two APIs to find out what your drink is based on what movie you are watching. The cocktail API has a database of over 635 drinks. 
    The movie API obtains information from user inputted database on content of the movie. From there, we match the movie with a drink that has been randomized! We hope you enjoy and drink responsibly.</p>
          <h3>
<ul> We used the following APIs:
        <li><a href="https://thecocktaildb.com/">www.thecocktaildb.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/">www.omdbapi.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Project 1 for Bootcamp: Used a CSS framework, successful application on Github Pages, interactive application, manipulated two server side APIs, used client-storage in order to store persistent data.
    Meant to be used as an application to pair drinks with what movie you want to watch. It will populate the drink name as well as movie name; give information on both and let you figure if it is the right drink for you to have.
